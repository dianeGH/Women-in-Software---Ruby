# Women-in-Software---Ruby
Tasks built in Ruby

The Ruby programming section of the Women in software bootcamp, oddly I have found this language the most challenging of all so far,
The simplicity of the syntax lulls you into a false sense of security, this is definitely a language I will be spending more time on!!
